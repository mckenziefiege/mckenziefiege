  "description": "Hi, I'm McKenzie! I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for creativity. My background in Psychology and Anthropology taught me to create apps that are intuitive and practical. I am captivated by striking and responsive web applications that are simultaneously beautiful and minimalistic. My goal is to incorporate this fascination into my own projects. When I'm not coding, I enjoy taking photos, hand lettering, traveling, tending to my house plants and petting dogs. Feel free to get in touch!",
