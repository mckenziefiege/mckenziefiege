  "description": "Hi, I'm McKenzie! I'm a Full Stack Developer living in NYC. I graduated from the College at Brockport with a degree in Psychology & a minor in anthropology. I discovered programming shortly after graduating and immediately fell in love with this new way of expressing my creativity. This background taught me to create apps that are intuitive and practical. I am captivated by striking and responsive web applications that are simultaneously beautiful and minimalistic. My goal is to incorporate this fascination into my own projects. After completing a full stack development program at the Flatiron School, I developed proficiency in JavaScript and React. In my free time,  I enjoy taking photos, traveling, admiring plants and petting dogs. Thanks for stopping by!",
